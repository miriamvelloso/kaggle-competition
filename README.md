# Kaggle-competition

The goal of this competition is the prediction of the price of diamonds based on their characteristics (weight, color, quality of cut, etc.), putting into practice all the machine learning techniques you know.

# Requirements

1. Train a minimum of 4 different models
2. Perform a minimum of 4 Feature Extraction and Engineering techniques
3. Documentation needed to reproduce the code
4. The code in .py and/or .ipynb files that allows to reproduce the exercise.
5. Functions must be in modules. ;)
6. The Readme must contain a summary of the machine learning tools and algorithms 
7. and the results or the score obtained with each of them.


# Possible techniques, in addition to studying the problem and drawing your conclusions:

* One hot encoding

* Label encoding

* Get dummies

* PCA

* Consumption of external API and / or web scraping

* Regression

# Possible regression models:

* LinearRegression

* DecisionTreeRegressor

* KNeighborsRegressor

* GradientBoostingRegressor

* RandomForestRegressor
